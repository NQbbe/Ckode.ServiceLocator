# Ckode.ServiceLocator
Ckode.ServiceLocator is a simple natively implemented service locator for simplifying dependency injection.

Usage:

This can be used in four ways:
1. To create an instance of a single class that implements a given interface.
2. To create an instance of every class that implements a given interface.
3. To create an instance of a single class that implements a given interface and defines a specified "LocatorKey".
4. To create an instance of every class that implements a given interface regardless of the "LocatorKey".


The examples in the Ckode.ServiceLocator.Examples project should give a better understand of how each variant works.
